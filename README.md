# Super Tic Tac Toe

### How to Play
- The board consists of 9 small tic tac toe boards (3x3), arranged to form a big 3x3 board.
- Players take turns placing their markers (X or O) in the empty squares
- Once a move has been played, the following move must be made in the small board corresponding to the square in which the move was made (unless the board has already been won)
- Once a player wins 3 small boards in a row (like classic Tic Tac Toe), they win the entire game
- If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw
